Much has happened, mostly parcels arriving, but today I picked up some shiney

These form the base of the mill. Once a fairly bland slab of 16mm 6082-T6, they have been transformed into lovely shiney goodness.

The guys that machined the plates were not able to drill some blind holes into the edges, which I'll need for the levelling/vibration feet. No great disaster as that will certainly fit into the machines at the engineering club. I also need to tap a 20 or so holes in M3/M4.

Today I also ordered the Bosch Rexroth profile and bits, so maybe by the end of the week I should have all the necessary bits to begin to put something together.

Pretty much all the other parts I was waiting for have arrived. The motors have finally deigned to appear at the post office. I guess shortly I ought to lay out all the parts and get some photos, before they dissapear into assemblies.

Since it's not very JIT to have nothing en-route I hit the money button on some more eBay pages.

  * SFU1204 L260 C7 rolled ballscrew, machined for BF/BK10
  * SCS35LUU linear bearing
  * Some 12mm/8mm couplings for the spindle, various designs

I finally decided that the 430mm long NSK 10/04 ballscrew just wasn't suitable for the Z axis. And the supplier doesn't seem to have anything else suitable, the nearest being a ~180mm 10/04 which would have ~75mm travel. The Chinese rolled ballscrews apparently aren't too bad these days, and at the price I decided to give it a try. Shipping from the land of the dragon, of course, is going to be sloooow.

The SCS35LUU happens to have a 52mm diameter through hole for the bearing. This is a convienient size for the spindle outer housing. The bearing holder is fairly long and I'm not entirely sure how this plan is going to work, but if it does I think it'll be a neat spindle mounting option.

The spindle design I'm working to requires a coupling between the 8mm motor shaft and the 12mm ER16 collet chuck. Since I'm not too sure which style of coupling is going to give the best, or even workable, solution, I opted to pick up a couple of them. One is a single diaphragm design, the other a more common "spider" design, like an advanced Lovejoy coupling. I guess we'll see what works best when they arrive.
