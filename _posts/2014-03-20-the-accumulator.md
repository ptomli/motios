So there's not been much activity on this here build log, but that's not because nothing has been happening.

The boats have been arriving.

The Turnigy G160 290KV, and associated ESC arrived. An epic level of Heath Robinson occurred, an old Nokia charger was employed, and the motor and controller were duly tested. My bench supply is capable of providing a fair bit of power, but the assorted crocodile clips, hookup wires and fingers meant I kept it to 24v and "a bit" of current. Then I pulled the motor apart to consider how it'll get integrated into the spindle.

I had read somewhere that these G160's are really easy to disassemble, and it was. Simply remove the circlip and fight against the magnets. Don't get your fingers in the way if it decides to snap closed again!

Then a parcel from Richon Tools arrived. I'd ordered a variety of end mills and drills and other assortments, including some coolant hoses and bases. I'm not intending to run flood, but I expect an air pump and/or maybe some form of _spittle_ will get employed. Besides, having a selection of tooling around keeps the preasure on to complete something in which to use them.

Then today I picked up a small parcel containing some limit switches and fuse holders. I've been looking at the available housings on eBay, contemplating just what I'll need to put into my electronics box, and fuses was high on the sensible list. Limit switches are also in that sensible category, though there's varying opinions about the usefulness of them on a small mill, driven by steppers and being controlled by Mach. I got them anyway, because it certainly won't hurt.

And there was a note in my mailbox this evening informing me that there were two parcels to be collected at the local post office. Now, I don't have tracking numbers for these, so it's a bit of a guess as to exactly what I'll be collecting, but I think it'll be the ballscrew bearing support bundle and the stepper motors. I'd picked up some Geckodrive G723-280-4 from eBay and they've been cruising across the Atlantic for a couple of weeks.

The eBay shipping fairies are still tracking the movements of some bearings, switches and screws. They're blissfully unaware of the magnets, hall effect sensors, low power DC regulators and laser diodes that are also apparently enroute. And I finally bit the bullet today and ordered the Geckodrive G203v's and Ethernet SmoothStepper.

I've also got a small pile of aluminium in the workshop but I haven't, however, made a cut on any of them yet. I'm sure the drawings and dimensions I've been working against are correct, but I'd hate for something to arrive only for me to discover that reality doesn't match design. So it's been a case of plenty of virtual machining in Rhino3D and not so much of the real thing.

I've also been working a bit on the mill design and have reworked the saddle plates to be easier to manufacture. Progress has also been made on the x axis, table and z axis. It's by no means finished, but getting there.
