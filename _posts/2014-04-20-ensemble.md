Well, it's time to make a serious start on this project.

I picked up the few pieces of Bosch Rexroth profile the other day and have since been engrossed in building a kitchen. Yeah, I don't see the correlation either, but that's what happened.

So I guess it's time to put up a visual inventory, a start point, if you will.

The base parts seen before, now with a little added extrusion

A trio of 10mm diameter, 4mm lead ballscrews

Ethernet SmoothStepper, Gecko motors and drives, switches for limits, power, and e-stop

Since I started jotting this post down, an insane 5 days ago, not much has actually happened but today I did manage to play with a Windows 7 VM for Mach3. The right amount of twiddling and I have Mach3 apparently doing something useful, though I've yet to plug in a drive and motor to test that theory.

I did discover that I have no idea what the Microsoft "engineers" were thinking when they came up with the idea that a network adaptor that's plugged into a network without a default gateway is "Unidentifiable" and "public". It's absolutely mind blowing.
